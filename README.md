# Forecasting House Prices Using Smart Regression Techniques

## Project Overview

Accurate house price prediction is essential for informed real estate decisions. This project uses the Ames Housing dataset to build robust regression models that forecast house prices based on various property features like size, quality, and location.

## Problem Statement

- **Type:** Supervised Regression  
- **Goal:** Predict `SalePrice` using property features  
- **Impact:** Supports buyers, sellers, and realtors with data-driven decisions

## Objectives

- Clean and preprocess real-world data
- Apply smart regression algorithms (Linear Regression, Random Forest)
- Enhance accuracy via feature engineering and tuning
- Interpret key factors influencing house prices

## Dataset Details

- **Source:** [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shree1992/housedata)  
- **Records:** ~4,600  
- **Features:** 18  
- **Target:** `SalePrice`

## Workflow

Data Collection → Preprocessing → EDA → Feature Engineering → Modeling → Evaluation → Visualization

## Key Techniques

- Handled missing values, outliers, and encoded categorical variables
- Created features like `Age`, `TotalBathrooms`
- Applied log transformation for normalization
- Trained models: Linear Regression (R² = 0.82), Random Forest (R² = 0.89)

## Tools & Libraries

- **Language:** Python  
- **IDE:** Google Colab, Jupyter Notebook  
- **Libraries:** pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, seaborn, matplotlib, XGBoost

## Results

- **Top Features:** `OverallQual`, `GrLivArea`, `GarageCars`, `TotalBathrooms`
- **Best Model:** Random Forest with RMSE ≈ 28,000
- Visuals: Feature importance, residual plots, price distributions

---

**Conclusion:** A high-performing, interpretable model that forecasts house prices with strong accuracy and real-world relevance.
